This python script can automate the process of creating a git hub repository manually, all you need to do is type 'create <repository-name> in command prompt and the script creates and returns the link of the repository.

There are two versions of the application,
    1) app.py uses the idea of web automation by selenium module
		* if so download the appropriate webdriver for you browser(Chrome/Firefox. etc)
    2) main.py uses the Github token to create repository


Change directories in create.bat, main.py
